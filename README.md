# Langium documentation

This repository contains the assets required to build the [Langium Website](langium.org/) and documentation.

Our setup uses TailwindCSS to build the styles which are then copied into the Hugo installation, from which our website is finally built.

# Getting Started
To install the required npm packages use
```
npm i
```
To start the website use 
```
npm run watch
```
You can find the website on [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313)
